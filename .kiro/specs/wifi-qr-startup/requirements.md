# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the SmartTV application to automatically display a QR code scanning interface when no WiFi connection is detected at startup. The system will provide a seamless onboarding experience for users to connect to WiFi using their mobile devices, while maintaining accessibility for users with mouse/keyboard input through a persistent homepage button.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a SmartTV user without WiFi connectivity, I want to see a QR code scanning screen immediately when the app starts, so that I can quickly connect to WiFi using my mobile device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the SmartTV application starts AND no WiFi connection is detected THEN the system SHALL display the QR code scanning interface instead of the homepage
2. WHEN the QR code scanning interface is displayed THEN the system SHALL show clear instructions for connecting via mobile app
3. WHEN the QR code scanning interface is active THEN the system SHALL continuously monitor for WiFi connectivity changes
4. WHEN a WiFi connection is established through QR scanning THEN the system SHALL automatically transition to the homepage

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a SmartTV user with mouse/keyboard access, I want to access the homepage even when WiFi is not connected, so that I can navigate the system manually if needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the QR code scanning interface is displayed THEN the system SHALL show a prominent "Homepage" button in the top navigation area
2. WHEN the Homepage button is clicked THEN the system SHALL navigate to the standard homepage regardless of WiFi status
3. WHEN on the homepage without WiFi THEN the system SHALL display WiFi connection status and provide access to WiFi settings
4. WHEN the Homepage button is displayed THEN it SHALL be easily accessible via keyboard navigation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a SmartTV user, I want the system to automatically detect when WiFi becomes available, so that I don't need to manually refresh or restart the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is running THEN the system SHALL continuously monitor WiFi connectivity status
2. WHEN WiFi connectivity changes from disconnected to connected THEN the system SHALL automatically update the UI within 5 seconds
3. WHEN WiFi is lost during normal operation THEN the system SHALL display a notification but NOT automatically switch to QR scanning mode
4. WHEN the system detects WiFi connectivity THEN it SHALL validate internet access before considering the connection successful

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a SmartTV user, I want the QR code scanning to work reliably with my mobile companion app, so that I can easily set up WiFi without typing passwords.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the QR scanner is active THEN the system SHALL access the device camera with appropriate permissions
2. WHEN a valid WiFi QR code is detected THEN the system SHALL parse the WiFi credentials and attempt connection
3. WHEN QR code connection is successful THEN the system SHALL save the network credentials for future use
4. WHEN QR code scanning fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and retry options
5. WHEN camera access is denied THEN the system SHALL show alternative connection methods

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a SmartTV user, I want visual feedback during the WiFi connection process, so that I understand what's happening and can troubleshoot if needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN attempting to connect to WiFi THEN the system SHALL display connection progress indicators
2. WHEN WiFi connection is in progress THEN the system SHALL show status messages and estimated time
3. WHEN WiFi connection succeeds THEN the system SHALL display a success message before transitioning to homepage
4. WHEN WiFi connection fails THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages and suggested actions
5. WHEN connection status changes THEN the system SHALL update visual indicators within 2 seconds
